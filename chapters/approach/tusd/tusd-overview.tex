Tusd is an open-source service designed to handle resumable file uploads, providing a reliable solution for large files and scenarios with unstable network connections.\enskip A key feature of Tusd is its native integration with cloud storage solutions, such as Azure Blob Storage. This built-in capability allows uploaded files to be rerouted directly to cloud storage without requiring custom implementation. This simplifies the upload process and ensures secure and efficient file storage.

The resumable upload functionality of Tusd works by splitting files into smaller chunks on the client side and uploading them individually. Each chunk is tracked, enabling interrupted uploads to resume without restarting from the beginning. Only the remaining chunks need to be uploaded.

By combining resumable upload functionality with robust cloud integration, Tusd delivers a seamless and efficient upload experience. These features make it a powerful tool for applications where reliability and performance are critical.
