\subsection{\ifenglish File Storage Structure\else โครงสร้างการจัดเก็บไฟล์\fi}

In our system implementation, all organizations share a single Azure Blob Storage instance. To prevent conflicts and ensure proper organization of uploaded files, a well-structured file hierarchy is essential. We designed a hierarchical file storage system that organizes files based on the organization and the video session, ensuring that the data for each organization and session remains isolated and easily accessible. The structure is as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
    Azure Blob Storage
    .
    |-organization1 ($orgName_$orgId)
    | |-records
    | | |-videoSession1 (e.g., 1725683830)
    | | | |-video1.mp4 (e.g., 1725683830.mp4)
    | | | |-video2.mp4
    | | | |-video1.tloc
    | | | |-video2.tloc
    | | | |-information.json
    | | |
    | | |-videoSession2 (e.g., 1725983830)
    | | | |-video1.mp4
    | | | |-video1.tloc
    | | | |-information.json
    | |-detected_images
    |
    |-organization2
    | |-records
    | | |-videoSession1 (e.g., 1725683830)
    | | | |-video1.mp4
    | | | |-video1.tloc
    | | | |-information.json
    | |-detected_images
\end{lstlisting}

The file storage structure follows these key principles:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Each organization has its own dedicated directory, named according to the organization's name and ID, separated by an underscore (e.g., \texttt{organization1\_1}).
    \item Within each organization's directory, there are two primary subdirectories: \texttt{records} and \texttt{detected\_images}. The \texttt{records} directory contains folders for each video session uploaded via the mobile application, while the \texttt{detected\_images} directory stores images generated by the object detection service, which will be further explained in the \textbf{Object Detection Service} section.
    \item Each video session folder within \texttt{records} includes the associated video files, timestamp location files, and a metadata file (\texttt{information.json}), as detailed in the Mobile Application section.
\end{itemize}
