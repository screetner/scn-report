The Detection Service is a component of the application responsible for identifying objects within a video stream. It operates by downloading a video session directory from Azure Blob Storage, processing the video for object detection, and finally converting the results into structured records for storage in a database. 

This pipeline is implemented in Python using Ultralytics' YOLO for object detection and tracking. The entire process consists of three sub-processes, orchestrated by the main process.
