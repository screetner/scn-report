\subsection{\ifenglish Object Tracking Process\else การดำเนินการติดตามวัตถุ\fi}
The Tracking Process focuses on performing object detection and tracking across video frames using Ultralytics' YOLO model. The process is designed to identify objects in each frame and assign a unique tracking ID to each object. This ensures consistent tracking of objects across multiple frames. The output from this process includes several key components: the detected frame object from YOLO, the Unix timestamp indicating when the frame was recorded, and a list of detected objects. Each object is accompanied by its tracking ID and bounding box coordinates, allowing for precise identification and localization within the frame.

    }[],
